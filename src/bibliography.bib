  abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the number of studies using evidence-accumulation models (such as the drift diffusion model, DDM) in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. These models go beyond observed behavior to extract descriptions of latent cognitive processes that have been linked to different brain substrates. Accordingly, it is important for psychology and neuroscience researchers to be able to understand published findings based on these models. However, many articles using (and explaining) these models assume that the reader already has a fairly deep understanding of (and interest in) the computational and mathematical underpinnings, which may limit many readers' ability to understand the results and appreciate the implications. The goal of this article is therefore to provide a practical introduction to the DDM and its application to behavioral data -- without requiring a deep background in mathematics or computational modeling. The article discusses the basic ideas underpinning the DDM, and explains the way that DDM results are normally presented and evaluated. It also provides a step-by-step example of how the DDM is implemented and used on an example dataset, and discusses methods for model validation and for presenting (and evaluating) model results. Supplementary material provides R code for all examples, along with the sample dataset described in the text, to allow interested readers to replicate the examples themselves. The article is primarily targeted at psychologists, neuroscientists, and health professionals with a background in experimental cognitive psychology and/or cognitive neuroscience, who are interested in understanding how DDMs are used in the literature, as well as some who may to go on to apply these approaches in their own work.},

  abstract   = {The SAT has long been a phenomenon of interest in behavioral science. From early on, the covariation between response speed and accuracy was seen not as a nuisance, but a signature of the decision process itself. Consequently, experimental investigations of SAT progressed largely in parallel with mathematical models of the decision process. This work is ongoing, but a consensus has emerged: agents make choices based on a sequential analysis of sensory evidence. As decades of research make clear, this decision process is adaptable: actions are dictated not only by the nature of perceptual input but also environmental constraints, internal goals, and biases. An embodiment of this flexibility, the SAT arises due to the inherent contradiction between response speed and decision accuracy. Faster responses entail less accumulated evidence, and hence less informed decisions. Sequential sampling models provide an intuitive framework for understanding SAT. Observers set a decision criterion---an amount of evidence required to commit to a choice---based on current task demands and internal goals. This begs the question: how can we know what decision criteria subjects employ? It would seem that without this knowledge, mean RTs and accuracy rates conflate experimental factors with strategic effects employed by the observer. The solution to this problem is to bring decision criterion6 under experimenter control. As explained below, this not only avoids ambiguity, but also quantifies precisely how accuracy trades off with latency.},

Sequential-sampling models like the diffusion model have a long history in psychology. They view decision making as a process of noisy accumulation of evidence from a stimulus. The standard model assumes that evidence accumulates at a constant rate during the second or two it takes to make a decision. This process can be linked to the behaviors of populations of neurons and to theories of optimality. Diffusion models have been used successfully in a range of cognitive tasks and as psychometric tools in clinical research to examine individual differences. In this article, we relate the models to both earlier and more recent research in psychology.},

Perceptual confidence refers to the ability to judge whether a perceptual decision is correct. We argue that metaperception is not limited to confidence but includes other judgments such as the estimation of familiarity and the aesthetic experience of sensory events. Perceptual confidence has recently received a surge of interests due in particular to the design of careful psychophysical experiments and powerful computational models. In psychophysics, the use of confidence ratings is the dominant methodology, but other paradigms are available, including the confidence forced choice. In this latter paradigm, participants are presented with two stimuli, make perceptual decisions about these stimuli, and then choose which decision is more likely to be correct. One benefit of confidence forced choice is that it disregards confidence biases to focus on confidence sensitivity. Confidence forced choice might also be a paradigm that will allow us to establish whether confidence is estimated serially or in parallel to the perceptual decision.},

  abstract = {The ability to recognize one's own successful cognitive processing, in e.g., perceptual or memory tasks, is often referred to as metacognition. How should we quantitatively measure such ability? Here we focus on a class of measures that assess the correspondence between trial-by-trial accuracy and one's own confidence. In general, for healthy subjects endowed with metacognitive sensitivity, when one is confident, one is more likely to be correct. Thus, the degree of association between accuracy and confidence can be taken as a quantitative measure of metacognition. However, many studies use a statistical correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson's r) or its variant to assess this degree of association, and such measures are susceptible to undesirable influences from factors such as response biases. Here we review other measures based on signal detection theory and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis that are ``bias free,'' and relate these quantities to the calibration and discrimination measures developed in the probability estimation literature. We go on to distinguish between the related concepts of metacognitive bias (a difference in subjective confidence despite basic task performance remaining constant), metacognitive sensitivity (how good one is at distinguishing between one's own correct and incorrect judgments) and metacognitive efficiency (a subject's level of metacognitive sensitivity given a certain level of task performance). Finally, we discuss how these three concepts pose interesting questions for the study of metacognition and conscious awareness.},

While a neuroscience of confidence has focused on the mechanisms underpinning subpersonal phenomena such as representations of uncertainty in the visual or motor system, metacognition research has been concerned with personal-level beliefs and knowledge about selfperformance. I provide a road map for bridging this divide by focusing on a particular class of confidence computation: propositional confidence in one's own (hypothetical) decisions or actions. Propositional confidence is informed by the observer's models of the world and their cognitive system, which may be more or less accurate---thus explaining why metacognitive judgments are inferential and sometimes diverge from task performance. Disparate findings on the neural basis of uncertainty and performance monitoring are integrated into a common framework, and a new understanding of the locus of action of metacognitive interventions is developed.},

In this probabilistic framework, the notion of certainty and confidence would appear to be closely related, so much so that it is tempting to conclude that these two concepts are one and the same. We argue that there are computational reasons to distinguish between these two concepts. Specifically, we propose that confidence should be defined as the probability that a decision or a proposition, overt or covert, is correct given the evidence, a critical quantity in complex sequential decisions. We suggest that the term certainty should be reserved to refer to the encoding of all other probability distributions over sensory and cognitive variables. We also discuss strategies for studying the neural codes for confidence and certainty and argue that clear definitions of neural codes are essential to understanding the relative contributions of various cortical areas to decision making.},

However, learning rates are jointly determined by the comparison between volatility and a second factor, moment-to-moment stochasticity. Yet much previous research has focused on simplified cases corresponding to estimation of either factor alone. Here, we introduce a learning model, in which both factors are learned simultaneously from experience, and use the model to simulate human and animal data across many seemingly disparate neuroscientific and behavioral phenomena. By considering the full problem of joint estimation, we highlight a set of previously unappreciated issues, arising from the mutual interdependence of inference about volatility and stochasticity. This interdependence complicates and enriches the interpretation of previous results, such as pathological learning in individuals with anxiety and following amygdala damage.},
